    This is a remix and rearrangement I created based on the orchestral piece Danse Macabre. Originally composed by Camille Saint-Saëns in 1872, Danse Macabre is a symphonic poem that was later reworked into its orchestral version in 1874. In this video, I take the piece on a time-travel journey, reinterpreting it through a 6-style remix approach.
